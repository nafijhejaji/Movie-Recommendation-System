# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Artificial Intelligence

A simple and effective **Movie Recommendation System** developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence Lab**.  
This project recommends movies to users based on their preferences using AI-based similarity techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

With the rapid growth of online streaming platforms, users often struggle to find movies that match their interests.  
This project aims to solve this problem by building an **AI-powered movie recommendation system** that suggests movies based on user behavior and movie similarity.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the working principles of recommendation systems
- Implement AI-based similarity algorithms
- Provide personalized movie recommendations
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets

---

## 🧠 Types of Recommendation Systems

This project focuses on:

### 1️⃣ Content-Based Filtering
- Recommends movies similar to those a user likes
- Uses movie features such as **genre, keywords, and ratings**
- Example: If a user likes *Action movies*, the system recommends similar action movies

> *(Future scope includes Collaborative and Hybrid filtering methods)*
